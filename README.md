# 🏥 Medic Insurance Cost Prediction

This project uses multiple machine learning models to predict individual medical insurance charges based on personal and lifestyle features. It includes full data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and deployment using a Streamlit web application.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to estimate the medical insurance cost for a person using factors like:

- Age
- Gender
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Smoking status
- Number of children
- Region

Users can interact with a **Streamlit-based web app** that takes these inputs and provides real-time cost predictions.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA)
- Scikit-learn (ML models)
- XGBoost
- Streamlit (for app deployment)
- Pickle (for model serialization)
